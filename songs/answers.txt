1. The average energy is around X (use results from your own query). The top 100 songs have a very energetic vibe, suggesting this listener prefers lively music.

2. The aura might be misleading because:
- It’s based on only 100 songs, not all songs listened to.
- It doesn’t weigh listening frequency (some songs may have been played once vs. hundreds of times).
- A more accurate approach would include listening frequency, skip rate, or recency of plays.
